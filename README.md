bD
=====

bD is a CMaked-based automated build generator. bD aims to significantly reduce the amount of learning required to fully utilize the productivity of CMake and is designed to enable fast iteration and allow programmers create and maintain source code with ease.

bD is particularly suited for C++ development with [Visual Studio](http://www.visualstudio.com/) and [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), while being mostly compatible with any other IDEs supported by CMake.
